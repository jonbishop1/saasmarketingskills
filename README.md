Hi, I'm Jon and I built this set of skills from my deep experience marketing SaaS products. It's designed specifically for technical founders and has over 15 skills and counting. Everything from audience research to content production and ads is covered and new ones are on the way. These skills encode the frameworks and processes I've used into conversational AI modules that give structured, opinionated strategy customized to your situation.

If you'd prefer a [human marketer](https://saasgrowthpros.com), whether it's for coaching, building out custom marketing skills, or having someone hands-on with your marketing, reach out at [SaaS Growth Pros](https://saasgrowthpros.com), my AI marketing agency for SaaS and AI companies.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills reference a shared background module (`saas-marketing-background`) that builds cumulative understanding of your product, audience, and goals across a session.

Skills chain naturally:

```
Audience Research → Copywriting → Landing Page → Google Ads → Analytics
         ↘ Content Strategy → SEO Research → Content Production ↗
```

Start anywhere. Claude routes to the right skill based on your question. Ask about your homepage copy and it pulls from the copywriting skill. Ask why your trial conversion is low and it activates onboarding and customer psychology together.

## Who This Is For

- **Technical founders** who need marketing leverage
- **Small dev teams** shipping product without a dedicated marketing hire
- **Indie hackers and bootstrappers** who want structured strategy and tactical expertise
- **Agencies building on Claude** who want plug-and-play marketing strategy for their clients
