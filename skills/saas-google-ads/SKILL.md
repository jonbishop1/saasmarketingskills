# Google Ads for Software Products
 
Audience: developers and technical founders. Explain things in engineering terms. Before advising, read `/mnt/skills/user/saas-marketing-background/references/background.md` and gather missing background.

## Google Ads — Additional Intake Questions
 
After gathering shared background, also ask these channel-specific questions:
 
**Keywords**
- High-intent terms they're confident about?
- Competitors users might also be evaluating?
- Terms that look relevant but attract the wrong audience?
- What would they search for? (symptoms, tools they use today, category terms)
 
**Google Ads current state**
- Ran Google Search Ads before? What worked/didn't?
- Conversion tracking set up and verified?
 
**Google Ads safe defaults (don't ask, just apply):**
 
| Parameter | Default |
|---|---|
| Device | All; -20–30% mobile for B2B |
| Ad schedule | All hours; business hours only for sales-led |
| Budget sizing | Target CPA × 3 minimum daily per campaign |
| Target CPA | Unknown — run Maximize Conversions until baseline established |
| Match types | Phrase + Exact to start; no Broad until 30+ conv/month |
 
**Channel-specific routing:**
 
| Situation | Where to go |
|---|---|
| No tracking set up | Set up tracking in `guide.md` → Conversion Tracking before anything else |
| Tracking set up, no campaigns | Account setup below → keywords/ads/bidding in `guide.md` |
| Campaigns running, underperforming | Verify tracking first (guide.md → Tracking) then Optimization section |
| Campaigns profitable, want to scale | guide.md → Scaling |

## How Google Search Ads Work
 
A keyword is not just a search term — it's a signal of buyer intent. The same concept ("api monitoring") searched different ways signals different stages of the buying journey. Your job is to match your spend to the highest-intent signals first.
 
The auction pipeline:
```
User query → Auction → Ad Rank → Click → Landing page → Conversion
     ↑                                                        |
     └──────────── Feedback loop (conversion signal) ─────────┘
```
 
**Ad Rank** = bid × Quality Score × expected impact of assets. You don't win by bidding highest — you win by having the highest Ad Rank, which means Quality Score is a cost multiplier. Improving QS lowers CPC without touching your bid.
 
**What Google doesn't tell you:** Google's revenue comes partly from inefficiency. Their automated suggestions (broad match expansion, Performance Max, auto-applied recommendations) often increase spend before they improve results. Treat account suggestions as hypotheses to test, not instructions to follow. The default campaign settings are not optimized for your goals — they're optimized for Google's revenue.
 
**Why search works for software:** Search captures demand that already exists. A user searching "rest api rate limiting library" has identified their problem and is actively looking for a solution. That query may have 200 searches/month globally, but the buyer intent is extremely high. This is fundamentally different from social ads, which interrupt people who weren't looking.
 
**When search doesn't work:** If your product category doesn't exist yet (common in AI), there may be no search volume for what you sell. In that case, you're educating the market — which search ads do poorly. Problem-aware keywords ("how to reduce api latency") can work, but expect lower conversion rates and higher CPAs.

## Is It Worth the Budget? Minimum Testing Formula
 
Before starting, determine if you have enough budget to get meaningful data:
 
```
Minimum monthly test budget = Target CPA × 50
 
Why 50: Smart bidding needs ~30 conversions/month to stabilize.
50 gives you headroom for learning period waste.
 
If you don't know your Target CPA yet:
  Estimate = LTV × acceptable CAC/LTV ratio
  Example: LTV $1,200, willing to spend 20% → Target CPA = $240
  Minimum budget = $240 × 50 = $12,000/month
 
Minimum daily budget per campaign = Target CPA × 3
Below this, smart bidding has too little signal per day to work.
```
 
If your budget is below this threshold, use Manual CPC and accept slower optimization — don't use smart bidding without the data to support it.

## Account Structure
 
```
Account
└── Campaign  (budget, network, bidding strategy, goal)
    └── Ad Group  (keyword theme + bid modifier)
        ├── Keywords
        └── Ads
```
 
**Campaign types for software (in order of when to add them):**
 
| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| Search | Always — start here exclusively |
| Display | Retargeting only, once you have converters to exclude/target |
| Demand Gen | Top-of-funnel awareness once Search is profitable |
| Performance Max | Only after 50+ conversions/month and solid tracking |
 
**Campaign structure by intent — not by internal org or budget cycle:**
 
```
Brand           → your product name + brand + pricing
Competitor      → named competitors users are evaluating
Category        → solution-aware ("api monitoring tool")
Problem-aware   → symptom-aware ("api keeps going down")
Feature-specific → exact feature searches ("webhook retry logic")
```
 
Keep Brand separate always — brand terms have low CPA and will consume budget from non-brand if mixed.

## Goals and Conversion Hierarchy
 
Set one primary conversion per campaign. Multiple primary conversions give the bidding algorithm conflicting signals.
 
```
Primary (bid on — pick ONE):
  PLG/SaaS:       free trial signup OR account creation
  Sales-led:      demo request OR contact sales form
  Dev tools:      API key created OR SDK first call
  Enterprise:     qualified demo booked OR MQL form
 
Secondary (track, don't bid on):
  - Demo video played
  - Pricing page visit > 30s
  - Docs page visit
  - Chatbot started
 
Micro (track for funnel visibility):
  - Blog post read > 60s
  - Newsletter signup
  - Any page view
```

## Campaign Settings — What to Change from Defaults
 
**Networks:** Uncheck Search Partners and Display Network. These are separate products bundled into Search by default. They dilute data and are harder to audit.
 
**Location:** Set explicitly. Default is "Presence or interest" — change to "Presence" only, or you'll show ads to people researching your target location from elsewhere.
 
**Ad rotation:** Set to "Do not optimize" while testing copy. Switch to "Optimize" once you have a winning variant.
 
**Ad schedule:** For B2B/enterprise, restrict to business hours. For PLG/dev tools with global self-serve buyers, leave all hours.
 
**Device bid adjustments:** For enterprise B2B, apply -20–30% on mobile — mobile rarely converts for high-consideration software purchases.

## Naming Conventions
 
Consistent naming makes filtering, reporting, and auditing faster at scale.
 
```
Campaigns:  [Type]_[Intent/Audience]_[Offer]_[YYYY-MM]
            Search_Competitor_FreeTrial_2024-03
            Search_Brand_Demo_2024-03
 
Ad Groups:  [Theme]_[MatchType]
            APIMonitoring_Exact
            ChurnReduction_Phrase
 
Ads:        [Angle]_[CTA]_v[N]
            ProblemHook_StartTrial_v1
            SocialProof_BookDemo_v2
```
